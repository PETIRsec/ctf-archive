# Genius Admire Simplicity

This is just a raw DLP challenge, the prime is very close to a Sophie Germain prime

The intended solution is to solve the DLP with NFS since the number is actually small enough. However implementing it manually will take too much labor so we can just do simple cado-nfs script kiddie type beat, please figure out the command yourself im not gonna bother teaching you to be a fully copy-paste script user

Second chall: todo, cek solver aja
